# go-auth

JSON Web Token authentication back-end in go

This application aims to provide a simple api to authenticate different
users across different services. Clients pass credentials to this
service and receive a token upon successful authentication. The token is
then used to validate the user for other services in the same realm.
More info on the JWT specification is available in the [ietf
draft](http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html).

**All requests** in which the token is interchanged must be carried out
over an encrypted channel. A malicious third party could easily obtain
the token otherwise, and act on behalf of the victim.

## Build and run the service

Clone and build binary. Expects that the cloned directory is present in
your $GOPATH

    $ git clone https://github.com/aspic/go-auth
    $ cd go-auth/
    $ go get && go build

The service is started by executing the binary with hostname and port
specified as an argument.

    $Â ./go-auth -local="localhost:8080"

## Configuration

An example configuration is located in **auth.config.example**. In order
to be able to run go-auth this file must be copied to **auth.config**,
and modified with your credentials.

### Simple Auth

This scheme is configured as displayed below:

    Auth = simpleAuth // Tells go-auth to use the simpleAuth backend.
    Username = user // Some username
    Password = password // Some password
    Key = key // A key to sign JWTs

Upon authentication go-auth will match username/password from the
request with the configured values. This scheme is most applicable for
testing and initial setup of the application.

## Usage

Run the service by:

    $ ./go-auth -local=":8080" # Answers on localhost:8080

If you have the stock configuration a token can be retrieved by issuing:

    $ curl http://localhost:8080/auth?username=username&password=password

The client has the responsebility to store this token. In subsequent
calls to protected resources the client can present this token to verify
itself.
